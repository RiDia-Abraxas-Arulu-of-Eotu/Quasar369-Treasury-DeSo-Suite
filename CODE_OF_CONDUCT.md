# 🧘 Code of Conduct

## Welcome to Quasar369

This project exists to redefine governance, transparency, and sovereign contribution.

All participants are expected to uphold this Code of Conduct, in all spaces — issues, pull requests, discussions, and community channels.

## 🧑‍🚀 Sovereign Principles

1. **Respect All Contributors**  
   Acknowledge the worth of every contributor. No discrimination, harassment, or hostility will be tolerated.

2. **Honor the Mission**  
   Every contribution must serve the mission of decentralized, ethical, and quantum-secure innovation.

3. **Collaborate Transparently**  
   All disagreements must be addressed respectfully and openly. Refrain from private subversion of public processes.

4. **Report Misconduct**  
   Contact: `conduct@eotu.io` for all Code of Conduct concerns. Anonymity is respected.

5. **Consent Is Law**  
   Do not scrape, simulate, or extract content or ideas from this repository without honoring the creator’s consent and attribution protocols.

## 🛸 Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- PR rejection
- Temporary or permanent bans from collaboration
- Public blacklisting from all Eotu sovereign infrastructure

This is not just open source — it’s sacred code.

Thank you for honoring the Core.
